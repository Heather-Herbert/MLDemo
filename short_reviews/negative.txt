Ignore removal requests for numerous fake reviews posted. Completely manipulated forum, waste of time. Disappointing responses from customer support. Too much money in it.
If I would have known that you were going to publish this, I would not have respoonded. I did not buy this product under my business name. And I thought that there a modicum of privacy in the purchase. Take that review down now.
Can't even get my name right. Not much else I can say. They've just plucked a name out of thin air and decided thats my name.
two of my reviews which I worked really hard for have been removed because thinks they are fake. My clients have replied to their emails to tell them they are legitimate but hide behind generic emails to me and them, do not provide a number for me to call or off any front line service. A normal case of a big business bot talking to their clients or offering a line of communication to help when required. So frustrating. like talking to a brick wall. Awful service from
Horrible customer service- no help whatsoever! AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE OR ONLINE. I give less than 1 star if possible!.
